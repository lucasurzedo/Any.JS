# WORKFLOW

## Update the local master
```
git pull
```

## Create new branch
```
git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
```

_Make the relevant implementations **ONLY** within the scope of your branch_

This means that if you find a bug or error or a new feature elsewhere outside the scope of the branch, another branch must be created to solve this new problem.

## Add changes
```
git add <FILENAME_OR_FOLDER>
git add .
git commit -m "<COMMIT_MESSAGE>"
```

## Create / update remote branch
```
git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH_NAME>
git push
```

Create the PR by selecting the branch you just created.

## Commits convention

```
<type>: <subject>
```
